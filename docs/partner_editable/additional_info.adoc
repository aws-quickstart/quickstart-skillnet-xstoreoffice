*Monitoring Infrastructure* 

After you implement your Oracle WebLogic applications in the AWS Cloud, you can continue to use the monitoring tools you are familiar with to monitor your Oracle WebLogic environment and the application you deployed on WebLogic.

You can use Fusion Middleware Control, the Oracle WebLogic Server Administration Console, or the command line (using the WSLT state command) to monitor your Oracle WebLogic infrastructure components. This includes WebLogic domains, Managed Servers, and clusters. You can also monitor the Java applications deployed and get information such as the state of your application, the number of active sessions, and response times. 

For more information about how to monitor Oracle WebLogic, see the https://www.oracle.com/middleware/technologies/weblogic.html[Oracle WebLogic documentation].

You can also use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the AWS Cloud resources the applications you run on AWS. Amazon CloudWatch enables you to monitor your AWS resources in near real-time, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon EBS volumes, Amazon EFS, Elasic Load Balancers, and Amazon RDS database instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. You can also supply your own logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage, transaction volumes, or error rates, which Amazon CloudWatch will also monitor.

With Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you can set a threshold on metrics and trigger an action when that threshold is exceeded. For example, you can create an alarm that is triggered when the CPU utilization on an EC2 instance crosses a threshold. You can also configure a notification of the event to be sent through SMS or email. Real-time alarms for metrics and events enable you to minimize downtime and potential business impact.
