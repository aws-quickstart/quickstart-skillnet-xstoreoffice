THe Oracle Retail Xstore suite enables in-store retail functions in medium to large enterprises across geographical regions. The Oracle Xstore suite relies on centrally hosted server applications to which the distributed in-store clients connect for data and transactional needs.

Retail enterprises have traditionally hosted the central applications on premises. Typically, these services would support connections from stores located in multiple geographies across time zones using a variety of local internet service providers. These pose a multitude of issues including availability, latency, and scaling to support peak loads. Retailers are looking at utilizing the AWS Cloud platform to host the Oracle Retail Xstore Office Application workload to realize the following benefits:

* Reliability
* High Availability
* Business Agility
* Faster Deployment Time
* Low Latency
